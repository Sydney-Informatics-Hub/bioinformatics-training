# Learners

This page brings together bioinformatics training materials developed by the Sydney Informatics Hub. These resources support researchers, students, and research support staff who use computational and data-intensive approaches in the life sciences.

The materials include hands-on workshops, short courses, and recorded webinars, and are designed to be practical and accessible. Our materials are focused on real research scenarios and suitable for learners from a range of backgrounds and experience levels. Many of these materials have been developed in collaboration with partner organisations: Australian BioCommons, QCIF, NCI, Pawsey Supercomputing Research Center, UNSW Structural Biology Facility, Monash Bioinformatics Platform, and Seqera.

If you have questions about suitability, access, or training opportunities, please [contact us](https://sih.tools/request).
